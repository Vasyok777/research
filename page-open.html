										<em>Osmosis is a sovereign decentralized exchange (DEX)-focused app-chain in the
											Cosmos
											ecosystem, meaning it simultaneously serves as a blockchain and an
											application.
											The
											application operates similarly to other automated market making (AMM)
											functioning
											DEXs –
											liquidity providers (LPs), which are responsible for supplying liquidity to
											asset
											pools
											where traders can make trades from. It’s the same model for Uniswap or
											Balancer,
											though
											more similar to the latter as Osmosis places a high priority on offering
											asset
											pool
											customization. Tweaks to market-maker functions, swap costs, token
											weighting,
											and
											more
											are all parameters that can be changed within the DEX. Additionally, Osmosis
											has
											introduced new features such as superfluid staking that allows users who
											provided
											liquidity in certain pools to also stake to help secure the network. In the
											future,
											Osmosis will also offer maximal extractable value (MEV) mitigation and
											capture,
											stable
											pools, and more.</em>

									<h4 class="key-title">OSMO 2.0</h4>
									<p class="key-osmo__text">On June 19, Osmosis shared <a href='#'>details</a>
										regarding
										its
										next
										development phase, with the release of an updated tokenomics model, OSMO 2.0.
										The
										model
										aims
										to improve the sustainability of the protocol and better align incentives.</p>
									<p class="key-osmo__subtitle">Reduced Inflation and Extended Emission Timeline</p>
									<p class='key-osmo__text'>
										Osmosis governance has voted to cut the inflation rate by half and lengthen the
										emission
										timeline beyond the initially planned mid-June timeframe, alongside the
										protocol's
										regular
										"Thirdening" inflation reduction event. The new schedule aims to enable a
										"smoother
										distribution of tokens over an extended period of time."
									</p>
									<p class="key-osmo__subtitle">Revised Token Emission Allocation</p>
									<p class='key-osmo__text'>The protocol will also shift its emission allocation to
										incentivize
										long-term stakers. Previously, Osmosis focused on rewarding liquidity providers
										to
										stimulate
										the growth of liquidity. However, the protocol's community has decided to
										redirect
										emissions
										from liquidity providers and the community pool to stakers. This shift is part
										of
										Osmosis'
										strategy to become a "DeFi-centric blockchain," supported by the Supercharged
										Liquidity
										feature.</p>
									<p class="key-osmo__subtitle">Protocol Revenue Burn Mechanism</p>
									<p class='key-osmo__text'>In January, Osmosis introduced an automated internal
										liquidity
										arbitrage mechanism and held the revenue collected from this module in a
										monitoring
										wallet.
										Governance has been considering options for using the generated revenue,
										including
										diversifying the Community Pool's holdings, incentivizing more staking, or
										initiating a
										burn
										mechanism.</p>
									<p class="key-osmo__subtitle">Fee Share Mechanism</p>
									<p class='key-osmo__text'>
										Currently, Osmosis allocates 45% of incentives to liquidity providers, while
										stakers
										receive
										25% of the emissions. To rebalance these allocations, Osmosis governance is
										considering
										implementing a <a href="">fee switch</a> for liquidity pools. The update would
										allow
										OSMO
										stakers to share
										in the swap fees generated by activity in Osmosis liquidity pools.

									<h4 class="key-title">Closing Summary</h4>
									<p class="key-summary__text">The second quarter saw a decline in volume, liquidity,
										and
										fees
										on
										the Osmosis network. IBC transfers and swap transactions fell the least in
										percentage
										terms,
										and net IBC transfers were over $400 million. In terms of proposals and network
										releases,
										Osmosis took numerous steps to not only improve its ecosystem and tokenomic
										design
										but
										also
										to incentivize users and increase security. The introduction of OSMO 2.0
										demonstrates an
										ongoing commitment to sustainability and better alignment of incentives through
										measures
										such as a reduced inflation rate, extended emission timeline, revised token
										emission
										allocation, a protocol revenue burn mechanism, and a fee share mechanism.
										Despite
										the
										decrease in key metrics, the network continues to adapt and implement new
										strategies
										for
										its
										growth.</p>
